        //That makes SwiftUI treat each button individually, so everything works as planned. And the result is much nicer to use: thereâ€™s no need to tap into a detail view with a picker here, because star ratings are more natural and more common.
        //We can disable the whole "tap the row to trigger its buttons" behavior with an extra modifier attached to the whole HStack:
        .buttonStyle(.plain)
